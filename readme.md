# Investigating the functional effects of mutations in a model enzyme 

This is the main repository for an ongoing project in the Siegel group ("the bagel project") to design and characterize the Michaelis-Menten kinetics and stability of mutants of a β-glucosidase ("bagel"). The researchers of the Bagel Team are investigating how point mutations to enzymes change functional parameters, stabilty, and structure. 

## For students

Welcome to the Bagel Team! 

### Background reading 

+ [BglB crystal structure](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607007413)
+ [Our group's first paper on Bagel project](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0147596)

### Get started with Foldit

First, get a [our group's internal copy of Foldit](http://fold.it/dist/internal/build/). Then, download the [BglB Rosetta model](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-foldit). Instructions for using Foldit can be found in the sme place. 

### Wet lab "boot camp"

Get started in the wet lab by following the [protocols for protein production, purification, and kinetic assay](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol) to produce, purify, and assay the BglB wild type protein, GFP, and two mutants. 

### Produce, purify, and assay your mutants in the wet lab

Following the procedures you learned in "boot camp", kinetically characterize the mutants that you designed. 

### Analyze your data and learn from the mutations you designed

Analyze your data using the [data analysis tools](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-fitter) ([internal UC Davis link](http://bagel.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu) and write up your results. Learn how the mutations you made changed the kinetic properties of BglB. 

## For teachers 

### Oligo design and Kunkel mutagenesis

+ [A complete set of mutageneic oligos for the BglB gene](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-orders) is provided, but students should have the experience of either 1) writing the code to generate all possible oligos for the BglB sequence (see repository for data), or 2) designing an oligo "by hand" using DNA editing software 

+ there is a rough version of the Kunkel mutagenesis protocol in [the provided protocols](http://github.com/dacarlin/bagel-protocol), and a [more complete Kunkel protocol on the Siegel group website](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3zIXvOOrmpqcEM5WWRadThsVUE)
